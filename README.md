# Project Description / Abstract

In this project, we collect data of various parameters of wine and test the corelation between each parameter and the wine quality level.

# Dataset

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). The goal is to predict the quality given those physicochemical attributes. Only the white wine dataset is used here.
