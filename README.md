You can provide a table with the names and the contact of all of the participants as follows:

Name 2	you@here.org
It is important to add your contact name as other people could use your code and may require any help.

Project Description / Abstract
Few lines explaining what your project consist on is always useful, so people don't have to read the code to understand what you are doing.

Dataset
You should include some lines explaining the dataset you are using, together with the link where you can download the data (if dealing with a public dataset).

Files and usage
You should explain all the files that you include, as well as how to use them.
