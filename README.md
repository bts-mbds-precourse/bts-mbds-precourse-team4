# Project Description / Abstract

Few lines explaining what your project consist on is always useful, so people don't have to read the code to understand what you are doing.

# Dataset

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). The goal is to predict the quality given those physicochemical attributes. Only the white wine dataset is used here.

# Files and usage
You should explain all the files that you include, as well as how to use them.

For example

    wine.py: This file contains the core of the project.
    plot_graphs.py: This file contains functions that graph data into different formats
    ...
    ...
**Usage**: Run the following command line into your terminal:

    python main.py
    
# Examples
If convenient, show some examples of the results you obtained during the project. 
    
# References
A list of references of other works that you may have used. At least the reference to the dataset must be included.
